## Purpose
UMHUB will be used to guide students to choose the correct program and courses under their degree path. It will show an outline of the course order the students should enrol in and provide an overview of different subjects and their professors. Users can choose to join the system to access other actions, including rating courses and professors. Each user is able to either create a personal account by signing up or can be guest user to have a brief overview of the system.

## How to run it
1. Run the project folder UMHUB-7/app

1. Initially, the application will view a home screen with two options -Login, and Continue as Guest

1. By choosing the later option, you can access limited major feature's of the system without signing up or logging in.

1. By choosing to login, you can either enter the system using the default username = "admin", and default password = "123456". Else you can type in a username and password of your choice and click Signup to create a new user. And then log in with the same credentials.

1. After valid credentials are entered, you will see a list of majors. Selecting one such major will take you to a list of programs available for that major. Selecting one program will show you a list of courses a student must take for the selected program.

1. Selecting a course from the list will let you access more course-specific features such as course reviews and tutors available.

1. You can also write a review and rate a tutor by clicking the respective buttons.

## Branching strategy

This project follows the Gitflow branching strategy. Different features are worked upon in different branches and then mergerd into the developer branch, discarding the feature branch, for testing the project together and then pushed onto the master once it is a stable release.
