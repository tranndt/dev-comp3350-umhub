## Iteration 1 Worksheet
### Adding a feature
In iteration 1, we focused on the feature that allows users to view different majors available at the university. When the application starts, it will show a home page where the users can click on the "Click here to proceed" button to view the list of majors. Furthermore, clicking one major will view the programs available under that major.

### Exceptional Code
This is where we used [Exceptional Code](UMHUB/app/src/main/java/comp3350/umhub/presentation/MajorsActivity.java). We used a try-catch exception handler to handle the exception that would arise when the variable is null. If the ArrayAdapter widget is a null value, then it would mean that the data values have not been loaded properly from the persistence package in the data layer. Then it will show an error message on screen.

### SOLID
Here is the link to [SOLID violation](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/group-8-overfeed-the-world/-/issues/20) found in group 8's repository. 

### Agile Planning

We pushed back the features [Show the illustration of degree plan](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/umhub-7/-/issues/3) and [Click on subject to view more](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a01/umhub-7/-/issues/4) to Iteration 2.
Initially we were only using the developer branch to push code into. Then we started using the branching strategy Gitflow and created a seperate branch for each seperate tasks.
